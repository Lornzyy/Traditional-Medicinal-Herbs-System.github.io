# Traditonal Medicinal Herbs System
This Traditional Medicinal Herbs System displays the traditional medicinal herbs collected in the Kihara area, Kiambaa constituency, Kiambu County in Kenya from the Kikuyu Community. This study will benefit the Kikuyu community and other communities in Kenya as they will have access to available traditional medicinal herbs remedies, which is easier to utilise other than borrowing from other countries.
